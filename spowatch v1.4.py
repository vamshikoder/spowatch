# * updates
'''
-> 4/20/2021 no need of any watch files.
-> 4/20/2021 watch files when deleted cause an error.
-> 4/20/2021 added comments to the file for good understanding.
-> 4/20/2021 added threshold.
-> 4/20/2021 now skip ad without lossing focus on spotify restart. focus is set back to the app that you were using before
-> [LATEST] 4/21/2021 performance improved when song is paused spowatch will not run ;)
-> [LATEST] 4/21/2021 Spowatch no longer shows song name on console for better performance.
